# Design, implementation and performance analysis of a vehicular cloud using Hadoop over wireless links

In the 20th century vehicular clouds has become a significant research area due to its specific features such as efficient traffic management, transport safety improvement, traffic congestion relieve and infotainment. Vehicles carry more communication systems and have more computing and storage power than ever. A single vehicle has limited computation and storage resources, which may result in low data processing capability. The idea of all the vehicles connected together creating a big cloud so that can collect, storage and analyze a large amount of traffic related data is a big challenge. In this cloud vehicles must share computation resources, storage resources and bandwidth resources. Several technologies have been deployed to maintain and promote Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). My [Master's Thesis]() presents the design and implementation of a hadoop based vehicular cloud. The proposed architecture is a layer above hadoop which combines all the advantages of hadoop framework with the advantages of wireless links between vehicles
